# Determining the length of a linked list
The function len_of_list is used to determine the length of the linked list 
using the iterative method.

The swap_nodes function is used to swap nodes in the list based on their 
key values which are passed as arguments when the function is called 

The reverse_nodes function is used to reverse nodes of a linked list iteratively

The remove_duplicates() function is used to delete duplicates in a linked list

The count_occurences() is used to count the number of times data is appearing 
in the list

The rotate() is used to rotate around a list about the passed pivot

The last function checks wether list is a palindrome
